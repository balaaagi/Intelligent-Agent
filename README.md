## CS-7637-001 Knowledge based Artifical Intelligence. 
## Objective

The main objective of this project is to create AI agent that can solve human intellience test consisting of [Raven's Progressive 
Matrices Problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raven%27s_Progressive_Matrices) using various concepts learned during the course.

## Technology Used
Java and Library Provided by University for reading the input Problem formats
